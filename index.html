      <p>First, concerning battlefield geometry, Ukrainian officers have begun to adjust their
        conception of the battlefield. Instead of the close, deep and rear, delineated by the
        depth of forces from the FLOT, Ukrainian planners now speak of a ‘contested zone’ or ‘grey zone’, which is
        usually bounded by open ground, where troops are exposed and
        within which forces are in contact. For troops to continue to contest this zone, they
        must be resupplied, and thus open areas across which resupply is difficult – such as
        rivers or open roads – often become markers of depth. Beyond the contested zone,
        Ukrainian commanders speak of the ‘middle battle area’, which they define as the area
        from which enemy systems can affect the contested zone. If the contested zone is
        usually 15 km across, the middle battle area extends up to approximately 30 km beyond
        the boundary of the contested zone, and it is from where enemy UAV orbits and
        artillery systems strike. Then, there is the ‘deep’, which Ukrainian commanders frame
        as the area where enemy reserves, logistics hubs, industrial targets or systems that
        cannot affect the contested zone but may do so in the future are situated.
        <br><br>
        Ukrainian commanders have divided their operations to seize a contested sector into
        approximately seven phases, usually spanning five to 10 days of operations. This
        practice does not constitute doctrine but is rather a synthesis of how multiple officers
        described their approach to the author, although their exact language varied. To seize a
        contested sector, the force must survey it, isolate it, degrade the enemy, fix their forces, suppress them,
        close and destroy them, and then consolidate control of the sector.
        These phases are described below.
        <br><br>
        To successfully attack a contested sector, it is necessary to conduct detailed
        reconnaissance of the enemy systems protecting it in the middle battle area. Critical
        targets to identify include the routes by which the enemy conducts resupply and
        rotation, gun positions, air defence positions, UAV launch points and pilots, and EW
        equipment. Much of this information can be gathered using electronic intelligence and
        by examining historical counterbattery data for the area. Remaining questions must be
        answered through deliberate reconnaissance, while general detections of enemy
        activity must be refined to specific points. In Ukraine, this detailed reconnaissance
        work is generally conducted using UAVs, but to be effective, it is necessary to first carry
        out a battle against enemy reconnaissance, in case the enemy shoots down the UAVs
        conducting the survey and kills their operators. The survey phase therefore comprises
        the systematic attrition of enemy reconnaissance over the contested zone, saturation
        attacks to suppress enemy air defence systems, and then extensive reconnaissance
        orbits in the middle battle area.
